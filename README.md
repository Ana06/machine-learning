# Computational Geometry

Projects for the Computational Geometry and Machine Learning course developed in Python.


## Modules

### fisher.py

The class Fisher offers methods to train and classify data using the Fisher's Linear Discriminant. Based on Chapter 4.1 from C.M. Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, 2007.

### reduce_dim.py

This module implements two mecanisms for dimensionality reduction. The first one is LDA, which performs the Linear Discrimant Analysis (based on Section 4.1.6 from C.M. Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, 2007), and the second is PCA, which implements the Principal Component Analysis (based on Section 12.1 from the same book).
        
### bezier.py

This module implements several algorithms to evaluate Bezier curves.

	
	
## Authors

This project is been developed by Ana María Martínez Gómez and Víctor Adolfo Gallego Alcalá. Although the development hadn't been possible without our teacher Antonio Valdés and his useful classes and feedback.
